# Twitter App

### Getting Started

My goal is to replicate the Twitter App using Ember Front-End Development. The look and functionality of the app will be a splitting image of Twitter.com.

+ The Advertising API is accessed on https://ads-api.twitter.com.
- Advertising accounts are registered on ads.twitter.com and identified in the API by account_id
+ Direct Message API
+ Tweets API
+ Accounts and Users API
+ Media API

### Running the tests
